<h2 id=manim>Making Math Videos with Manim</h2>

</figure>

<p>When the world shutdown in early 2020, everyone suddenly had a bunch of free time on their hands. I decided to spend that time learning how use <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">Grant Sanderson's</a> manim library.</p>

<p>For those who don't know what manim is, it's essentially a tool that allows one to programmatically create a video. If you're interested in trying manim, I wrote a <a href="articles/getting-started-with-manim.html">short article on how to get started</a>.</p>

<p>Here's probably what's my favorite video I've made. It's an animation of the Lorenz Attractor.</p>

<p>Here's another cool strange attractor: the Aizawa Attractor.</p>

<p>I'm a little disappointed with where the manim project is headed. In 2020, the <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">original manim project</a> was forked into what is now the <a href="https://www.manim.community/">community edition</a> (the community edition is named <code>manim</code> on pip). The community edition is meant to be better tested and more stable. However, the developers who maintain the community edition have been making odd decisions lately. It seems that nowadays, the "community" is bent on enforcing their code of conduct, rather than writing good code. Nevertheless, I do plan on making manim videos well into the future.</p>
<ul>

<p>I probably don't have too much to say about LaTeX that hasn't already been said. In the past few months, I've also been playing around with GNU Troff as an alternative to LaTeX.</p>

<p><strong>I made several high-quality LaTeX templates that saw widespread adoption at my university.</strong> You <a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/LaTeX-templates">can find them here</a>. In that repo you'll find</p>
<ul>
    <li>My CV/r√©sum√©</li>
    <li>Beamer presentations</li>
    <li>Many article templates (including an article that demonstrates good practice)</li>
    <li>Homework template for university coursework</li>
    <li>And much more üòÅ</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=vectorgraphics>Vector Graphics</h2>

<p>Something I really enjoy doing is making vector graphics. And my favorite program for doing so is <a href="https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/">Asymptote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing. Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX, the de-facto standard for typesetting mathematics. A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages is that it is a programming language, as opposed to just a graphics program.
</blockquote>

<p>Asymptote is incredibly fun to use because there's literally no limit to what can be done. And I especially like that Asymptote uses C-like syntax.</p>

<p><strong>If you or anyone you know is writing a technical report and needs some high-quality graphics, <a href="contact.html">get in contact with me</a> and we'll figure something out</strong>.</p>

<h2 id=suckless>Suckless Software</h2>

<p>If you've been using computers for a while now, I'm sure you've noticed that they are becoming increasingly frustrating to use. The hardware of today is wicked good compared to even just a few years ago, but the programs you run on a daily basis aren't getting any faster.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, when software developers aren't constrained by hardware limitations, the code they write has a tendancy to become extremely complex, bloated, and inefficient. All because the devs can afford to get away with it. As a result, modern programs are needlessly complicated and hard to use.</p>

<p>The developers at <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> are fixing this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry . . . Our project focuses on advanced and experienced computer users. In contrast with the usual proprietary software world or many mainstream open source projects that focus more on average and non-technical end users, we think that experienced users are mostly ignored.
</blockquote>

<p>Simplicity is at the heart of the UNIX philosophy. And suckless software is incredibly simple. For instance, their <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">window manager</a> doesn't exceed 2000 SLOC. And that means it's simple enough for anyone to configure by directly modifying the source code.</p>

<p>Here are all of the forks of suckless software that I maintain:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/dwm">dwm</a> (window manager)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/st">st</a> (terminal emulator)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/slstatus">slstatus</a> (status bar for dwm)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/dmenu">dmenu</a> (run launcher)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/slock">slock</a> (display locker)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=introphys>University Physics: Electromagnetism and Optics</h2>

<p>I spent a number of semesters as a teaching assistant for one of the introductory physics courses at <a href="https://physics.mines.edu">The Colorado School of Mines</a>. I like to think that I was <a href="files/evals.pdf">pretty good</a> at my job.</p>

<p>I made a number of teaching resources for that course that I might publish to this website. But more importantly, <strong>if you or anyone you know is in need of private tutoring, <a href="contact.html">get in contact with me</a> and we'll figure something out</strong>. I have loads of experience with electromagnetism and optics, but I'm willing to help with any related courses as well (e.g. calculus III or differential equations).</p>
