<p>When the world shutdown in early 2020, everyone suddenly had a bunch of free time on their hands. I decided to spend that time learning how use <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">Grant Sanderson's</a> manim library.</p>

<p>For those who don't know what manim is, it's essentially a tool that allows one to programmatically create a video. If you're interested in trying manim, I wrote a <a href="articles/manim.html">short article on how to get started</a>.</p>

<p>Here's probably what's my favorite video I've made. It's an animation of the Lorenz Attractor.</p>

<p>Here's another cool strange attractor: the Aizawa Attractor.</p>

<p>I'm a little disappointed with where the manim project is headed. In 2020, the <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">original manim project</a> was forked into what is now the <a href="https://www.manim.community/">community edition</a> (the community edition is named <code>manim</code> on pip). The community edition is meant to be better tested and more stable. However, the developers who maintain the community edition have made some questionable (to put it charitably) decisions. It seems that nowadays, the "community" is bent on enforcing their cringe code of conduct, rather than writing good code. Nevertheless, I do plan on making manim videos well into the future.</p>

<h2 id=suckless>Suckless Software</h2>

<p>If you've been using computers for a while now, I'm sure you've noticed that they are becoming increasingly frustrating to use. The hardware of today is wicked good compared to even just a few years ago, but the programs you run on a daily basis aren't getting any faster.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, when software developers aren't constrained by hardware limitations, the code they write has a tendancy to become extremely complex, bloated, and inefficient. All because the devs can afford to get away with it.</p>

<p>All of this snowballs into the problem we find ourselves in: despite having incredibly good hardware, computers aren't really getting any faster or easier to use. Quite the opposite. Modern programs are needlessly complicated and hard to use.</p>

<p>The developers at <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> are fixing this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry . . . Our project focuses on advanced and experienced computer users. In contrast with the usual proprietary software world or many mainstream open source projects that focus more on average and non-technical end users, we think that experienced users are mostly ignored.
</blockquote>

<p>Simplicity is at the heart of the UNIX philosophy. And suckless software is incredibly simple. For instance, their <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">window manager</a> doesn't exceed 2000 SLOC. And that means it's simple enough for anyone to configure by directly modifying the source code.</p>

<p>Here are all of the forks of suckless software that I maintain:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/dwm">dwm</a> (window manager)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/st">st</a> (terminal emulator)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/slstatus">slstatus</a> (status bar for dwm)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/dmenu">dmenu</a> (run launcher)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/slock">slock</a> (display locker)</li>
</ul>

<p>I maintain a bootstrapping script to configure a sleek, comfortable, and fully-featured Linux environment. If you've heard of <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a>, this script does a very s </p>
