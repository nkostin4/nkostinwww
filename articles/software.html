<h1>Some Musings on Software</h1>

<p>by <a href="../index.html">N. Kostin</a></p>

<p>Here's something taken from <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">suckless.org</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector. Unfortunately, the tendency for complex, error-prone and slow software seems to be prevalent in the present-day software industry. We intend to prove the opposite with our software projects . . . Our project focuses on advanced and experienced computer users. In contrast with the usual proprietary software world or many mainstream open source projects that focus more on average and non-technical end users, we think that experienced users are mostly ignored. This is particularly true for user interfaces, such as graphical environments on desktop computers, on mobile devices, and in so-called Web applications."
