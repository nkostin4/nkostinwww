<p>Zoomers are literally going to have no clue what I'm about to talk about. But maybe what I have to say will resonate with millennials/gen-x/boomers . . .</p>

<p>Back in the day, websites actually used to be fun to browse. It was fun to fire up the family computer, launch Netscape Navigator, and go to your favorite webpages. Of course, the whole ordeal took a few minutes because DSL internet connections typically weren't that fast.</p>

<p>The internet was a magical place. Every website had crazy flashing gifs and bright colors. Maybe there were spinning gifs of flying UFOs. Maybe you frequented a bigfoot site that had all sorts of folklore and magic. Anybody could put whatever they wanted on the internet.</p>

<p>Best of all, you found all these websites yourself, just by surfing the web. Google certainly didn't exist (maybe every now and then you Asked Jeeves). If you wanted to talk to your friends, you used IRC.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Platforms</h2>

<p>The comfy days of the 90s are long gone.  </p>

<p>The main culprit are social media. Social media sites can use the extreme amounts of power in bad ways.</p>

<h2>I'm Doing My Part!</h2>

<p>All that being said, I've finally deployed my new (extremely lightweight) website. In fact, you're looking at it right now. This'll be a place where I publish guides, musings on various things, and possibly much more 😀</p>

<p>In the spirit of the old internet, this website is written to be simple and minimal. I think this is how all websites should be designed.</p>

<p>There's no stupid JavaScript running. No cookies. Just HTML and CSS, as it should be.</p>
