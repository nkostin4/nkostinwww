<p>Cell phones are on the next level of frustration in terms of configuring and really owning. Just being able to root a device is a huge and painful rigmarole.</p>

<p>Administrative access really determines whether you own a computer.</p>

<p>With cell phones, I keep them in my pocket all day and it radiates my testicles all day as it sends data to Google. It's really Google's phone.</p>

<p>I can't stand in-cells who are always invested in what is going on in their monitoring devices. Can you not just act like a normal human uninfested by the hivemind for just one moment?</p>

<p>How can I respect women if I'm not constantly mesaging them on the internet?</p>

<p>Cell phones? I hate those things.</p>

<p>I pretty much keep my cell phone at my home at all times.</p>

<p>As Luke Smith already said, phones are designed to prevent you from doing what you want with them. THey are built to keep the user away from actually owning their phone and doing what you want with it. he mere fact that you have to go through to process of rooting a phone to gain basic access to it tells you enough.</p>
