<h2 id=intro>Intro</h2>

<p>I probably don't have too much to say here that hasn't been said before. So instead, I'll just leave a few remarks on specific distros that I've used. That being said, I can point you to a few resources that have helped me along the way:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Luke Smith's <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/distros">review of Linux distros</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f5uev7UTz0">This video</a> by Mental Outlaw.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=arch>Arch/Artix</h2>

<img class=resright src=../pix/linux/arch.png>

<p><a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix</a> is my favorite distribution. It's pretty much identical to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, except for Artix allows the choice of using either OpenRC, Runit, or s6 as the init system.</p>

<p>I maintain a shell script (inspired by <a href="https://larbs.xyz">Luke Smith's LARBS</a>) that deploys a fully-featured desktop environment on any Arch-based system, thereby saving you from the headache of manual setting up your programs and dotfiles. Feel free to take a look at it <a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/deploy-artix">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id=nixos>NixOS (aka "le shill flake")</h2>

<p><a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a> is unique in that the <emph>entire operating system</emph> (from the kernel to the system packages to the configuration files) are built by the Nix package manager, and all packages are kept in <code>/nix/store</code>. In fact, the directory structure is widly different than on pretty much any other distro.</p>

<img class=resright src=../pix/linux/nixos.png>

<p>The entire system is meant to be configured using a single <code>configuration.nix</code> file stored in <code>/etc/nixos/</code>.</p>

<p>And because the entire system is built by the Nix package manager, there's a bunch of cool things that come with using NixOS:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reproducable system configurations. Nix builds packages in isolation from each other, meaning that everything is reproducible and nothing has undeclared dependencies. The excuse "it works on my machine lol" doesn't work anymore.</li>
    <li>Reliable upgrades. Installing or upgrading one package cannot break others. And if you decide that you don't like your current configuration, you can always roll back to a previous version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, because Nix builds packages in isolation from each other, there can be some problems. Notably for me, getting compiling my personal builds of suckless software was a huge chore. There does <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/St">seem to be a workaround</a>, but I've had limited success with this method.</p>

<p>If you want my NixOS configuration, you can get it <a href="https://github.com/nkostin4/deploy-nixos">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id=mint>Linux Mint</h2>

<p><a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> is one of my favorite distros, and it's the first distro I used long-term. Mint is a fantastic distro for novices and power-users alike - it comes with a great suite of software, it's easy to customize, it's fast, and it "just werks".</p>

<img class=resright src=../pix/linux/mint.png>

<p>Linux Mint also does not support snaps, which I think is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPXLpLwEQ_E">fantastic choice</a> on behalf of the Mint team.</p>

<p>Linux Mint ships with three desktop environments: Cinnamon (the flagship edition), MAE, and Xfce. I've only used the Xfce DE (which by itself is pretty ugly), but the Mint team does a great job of making it pretty and user-friendly, while keeping it extremely lightweight.</p>

<p>Perhaps my only criticism of Mint is that it installs <em>everything in the kitchen sink</em>. On a fresh-installation, the number of packages clocks in at over 2000 (which I think is a bit much).</p>
