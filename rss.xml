    <title>My New Website is Live</title>
    <description>
        <![CDATA[ <p>I've finally deployed my new (extremely lightweight) website. This'll be a place where I publish guides, musings on various things, and possibly much more ðŸ˜€</p> <p>In the spirit of the old internet, this website is written to be simple and minimal. I think this is how all websites should be designed.</p> <p>There's no stupid JavaScript running. No cookies. Just HTML and CSS, as it should be.</p> ]]>
