<p>Zoomers are literally going to have no clue what I'm about to talk about. But maybe what I have to say will resonate with millennials/gen-x/boomers . . .</p>

<p>Back in the day, websites actually used to be fun to browse. It was fun to turn on the family computer, launch Netscape Navigator, and go to your favorite webpages on a DSL internet connection. Every website had crazy flashing gifs and bright colors. Maybe there were spinning gifs of flying UFOs. Maybe you frequented a bigfoot site that had all sorts of folklore and magic.</p>

<p>The internet in the 90s (maybe even the early 00s) was a magical place. Anybody could put whatever they wanted to on the internet. Websites had soul and character. Meaningful discourse took place on IRC channels. There were no social media sites.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the comfy days of the 90s are long gone. The content that is posted online is heavily filtered on social media platforms. Websites are bloated with ads and trackers. Any sort of online discussions usually happen on social media platforms, where users (whether they realize it or not) are subject to behavioral engineering at a massive scale.</p>

<p>But how did this shift happen? Let's find out.</p>

<h2>Platforms, Social Media, and Centralization</h2>

<p>There's a sense in which the internet can be a little hard to use. It's easy to see how, say, setting up an IRC channel would be difficult for a normie. Even learning HTML and CSS, let alone managing a webserver, can definitely be a difficult process.</p>

<p>Social media platforms make that process easy for people.</p>

<h2>Become an Internet LandChad</h2>

<p>Start taking the steps to become independent of big tech. Delete your social media accounts.</p>

<h3>I'm Doing My Part!</h3>

<p>All that being said, I've finally deployed my new (extremely lightweight) website. In fact, you're looking at it right now. This'll be a place where I publish guides, musings on various things, and possibly much more üòÄ</p>

<p>In the spirit of the old internet, this website is written to be simple and minimal. I think this is how all websites should be designed.</p>

<p>There's no stupid JavaScript running. No cookies. Just HTML and CSS, as it should be.</p>
