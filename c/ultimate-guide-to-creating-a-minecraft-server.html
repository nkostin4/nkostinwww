<h2 id=intro>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you've ever wanted to play multi-player Minecraft, the options that most people consider are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms">Minecraft Realms</a> subscription from Microsoft.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pros:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Probably easiest to configure.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Only for vanilla Minecraft - there's no option to run modded Minecraft.</li>
            <li>Zero world customization. A Minecraft Realm generates the world from a random seed. There's no option to, say, generate a superflat world.</li>
            <li>There's a relatively prohibative player limit. Only 10 players can play at a given time.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Server hosting, from services such as <a href="https://shockbyte.com/">Shockbyte</a> or <a href="https://apexminecrafthosting.com/">Apex Hosting</a>.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pros: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Better customization options than with Minecraft Realms.</li>
            <li>Support teams and automatic server backups.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Becomes rather expensive quickly for anything other than the most basic plans.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Running a Minecraft server using a VPS (virtual private server).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pros:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The most customization. You have the freedom to set the world seed, the max player limit, toggle PVP, and so much more.</li>
            <li>Ability to run any mods, and install any modpacks.</li>
            <li>Cheapest option if done correctly. Paying for the amount of bandwidth you use means that you can simply turn the server off while nobody is playing, such that excess costs are not accrued.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Probably the most difficult to configure (hopefully less so with my guide!)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><em>Accordingly, I maintain that by far the most extensible and cost-effective to play multi-player Minecraft is to run your own VPS.</em></p>

<p>What follows is meant to be a self-contained guide to launching and maintaining a Minecraft Java-Edition server. No pre-requisite technical knowledge and certainly no special computer hardware is needed to follow this guide.</p>
